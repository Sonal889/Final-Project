During my internship, I worked on creating a responsive portfolio website using HTML and CSS. The project included building multiple sections such as a landing page, about section, skills, 
projects, and a contact form.
I deepened my understanding of semantic HTML and how to structure content meaningfully.
I learned to apply CSS flexbox and grid to build responsive layouts.
Gained hands-on experience in using media queries to create mobile-first designs.
Improved my ability to use developer tools in browsers to inspect and debug CSS issues.
Practiced writing clean, maintainable code and organizing it with comments and separate style sheets.
Challenges I Overcame:
Responsive Design Issues: Initially, the layout would break on smaller screens. I resolved this by mastering media queries and restructuring the layout using flexbox.
CSS Specificity Conflicts: I faced issues where some styles werenâ€™t applying properly. I learned how to manage selector specificity and avoid overuse of !important.
